# input("Enter your name :")

# With this statement the prompt will be displayed in the console window and it will also take the input name
# but it will not do anything else

# declare the data entered by user as an variable before to store the information and to call it when needed

name = input("Enter your name : ")

# age = input("Enter your age : ")
# age = int(age)

# Since we are going to perform mathematical operation we need to convert it into float or int data type as user input
# is always str type
# We can typecast it into our preferred data type in single line as:

age = int(input("Enter your age : "))
age = age + 1
 
print(f"Hello {name}.")
print(f"{name} is going to be {age} years old next year")
