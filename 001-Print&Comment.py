# everything # is a comment until "enter key is pressed"

# syntax to output is simple --  print("whatever u wanna print ") -- take note that single inverted comma '' can be used
#                                as well
#                            -- it prints whatever string is written in between the inverted commas


# , I think is used to end the statement ....

print('I love pizza!')
# print ('It's really delicious')------->>running it will give error
# that is why we usually use "" because it prevents errors like this

print("It's really delicious")
